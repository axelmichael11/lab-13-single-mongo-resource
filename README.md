# Build Tool Instructions
* create a package.json that lists all dependencies and developer dependencies
* include a .env and .test.env
* include an .eslintrc DONE
* include a .gitignore DONE

# Directions
* Create these directories to organize your code: DONE
 * lib
 * model
 * route
 * db
 * test
* Create a HTTP Server using `express` DONE-- might need to refactor
* Come up with two models that have a one to many relationship


* using mongoose create the first resource in the one to many relationship
 * it can not have the same properties as the in class sample code, or yesterdays lab
 * make sure you include at least one propertie with the `unique` validator set to true
 * Also include two other properties of your choice (like name, creationDate, etc.)
* use the `body-parser` express middleware to on `POST` and `PUT` routes

## Server Endpoints
### `/api/resource-name`
* `POST` request
 * pass data as stringified json in the body of a post request to create a resource

### `/api/resource-name/:id`
* `GET` request
 * pass the id of a resource though the query string to fetch a resource   
* `PUT` request
 * pass data as stringified json in the body of a put request to update a resource
* `DELETE` request
 * pass the id of a resource though the query string to delete a resource   

## Tests
* your tests should start your server when they begin and stop your server when they finish
* write a test to ensure that your api returns a status code of 404 for routes that have not been registered
* write tests to ensure your `/api/resource-name` endpoint responds as described for each condition below:
 * `GET` - test 404, responds with 'not found' for valid request made with an id that was not found
 * `GET` - test 200, response body like `{<data>}` for a request made with a valid id
 * `PUT` - test 200, response body like  `{<data>}` for a post request with a valid body
 * `PUT` - test 400, with invalid body
 * `PUT` - test 404, with invalid id
 * `DELETE` - test 204, with valid id
 * `DELETE` - test 404, with invalid id
 * `POST` - test 200, response body like  `{<data>}` for a post request with a valid body
 * `POST` - test 400, with an invalid request body
 * `POST` - test 409, with an a conflict for a unique property

 # Bonus 2pts
* create a `GET /api/resource` route that has pagination using query strings
